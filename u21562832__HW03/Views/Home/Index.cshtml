                The following information will be a description of how the system works. The system inlcudes a Home page (that you
                are currently reading) that includes a form where the user needs to select whether they want to uploada file,image or
                vide. On this page, the user will then be able to select the fileon their computer which will then be uploaded on submit
                of the form. A files page where the systems must display a list of all the files that the user has uploaded.
                The files page also has the functionality of deleting and downloading the file.

            </p>

            <p>
                The system includes a Images page taht must display all the images the user (the images must be viewable) that
                the user uploaded. The page has two functionalities that are to delete and download the images. Similarly to the images page,
                the video page must display all the videos (the videos must be playable) that the user uploaded in an orderly way. It includes
                the same two functionalities as the images page where the user can delete or download the videos.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, the system has a page that lets the user read more about the person who created the program.
                The about me page should display a biography along with a picture (image) of the person who programmed the project. This is a helpful.
                as this project will be uploaded to your GitHub repository that you will be able to share down the line
